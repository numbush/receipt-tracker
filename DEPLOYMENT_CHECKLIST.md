## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Setup
- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Push code to GitHub:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/receipt-tracker.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  ```

### 2. MongoDB Setup (if needed)
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas account created
- [ ] Database cluster created (free tier M0)
- [ ] Database user created with read/write permissions
- [ ] Network access configured (0.0.0.0/0)
- [ ] Connection string obtained

### 3. Vercel Deployment
- [ ] Vercel account created/logged in
- [ ] Project imported from GitHub
- [ ] Environment variables configured:
  - [ ] `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string
  - [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Random secure string
  - [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Vercel app URL
- [ ] Deployment initiated

### 4. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Deployment successful (check Vercel dashboard)
- [ ] App URL obtained
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` updated with actual URL
- [ ] App redeployed with correct URL

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Navigation works correctly
- [ ] No console errors in browser

- [ ] Camera capture works on mobile
- [ ] Image preview displays correctly

### Receipt Management

- [ ] PWA features work (if applicable)

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

Required for production:

| Variable | Source | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB Atlas | `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/receipts` |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Generate random | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Vercel deployment | `https://your-app.vercel.app` |

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Failures
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Verify all dependencies in package.json
- Ensure TypeScript types are correct

### Database Connection
- Verify MongoDB connection string format
- Check database user permissions
- Confirm network access settings (0.0.0.0/0)

### Camera Issues
- HTTPS required (Vercel provides this)
- Test on different browsers/devices
- Check browser permissions

### Environment Variables
- Set in Vercel dashboard, not in code
- Use "Production" environment
- Redeploy after changes

## ðŸ“± Mobile Testing

Test on various devices:
- [ ] iPhone Safari
- [ ] Android Chrome
- [ ] iPad
- [ ] Different screen sizes

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Camera capture works
- [ ] Receipts can be saved
- [ ] Database stores data correctly
- [ ] Mobile experience is smooth
- [ ] No critical console errors
